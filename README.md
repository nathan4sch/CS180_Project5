# Project 5 - Furniture Marketplace

## CS 18000 GLD Capstone Project

### Description
This is a furniture reselling marketplace where users can buy and sell items. Users can create an account that is either a Buyer or Seller with their information saved between sessions. To access their account after creation, users just have to log into their account by entering the correct credentials. 

For buyers, the Buyer Dashboard shows a marketplace listing page shows the store, product name, and price of the available goods. This dashboard can be sorted by price and amount of items available, and users can search for specific products. Buyers can add the marketplace items to their cart, remove items from their cart, and checkout their items in cart. Buyers can also view and export a file of their purchase history. Buyers can view statistics of the stores they bought from and all stores by the number of their products sold; these statistics can be sorted by quantity from most to least. Lastly buyers can change their passwords and delete their accounts.

For sellers, the Seller Dashboard has many options including creating stores, creating products for a specific store, and viewing items currently in the buyers' carts. Under managing stores, sellers can view a list of all sales of the selected store, view the statistics of their stores, import product files, and delete their stores. Sellers can then select a store and modify the products sold under the store. This includes adding a new product, editing existing products, deleting a selected product, and exporting a product file. Lastly, sellers can change their passwords and delete their accounts.
